## Description:

Greetings!

This **Final Exams Table** is an HTML workshop offered by freeCodeCamp. 

The goal of this project is to reinforce practical HTML knowledge by building a fully functional final exam table that emulates real-world form interactions. The table will showcase commonly used semantic elements—including ```<input>, <button>, <label>, <thead>, <tbody>```, and layout tags such as ```<div>``` and ```<section>```—to help developers grasp the structure, accessibility, and styling flexibility of HTML tables in data-centric applications.
